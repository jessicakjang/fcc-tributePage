					<img src="" alt="movie1_image">
					<p class="summary">Although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 legally desegregated the South, discrimination was still rampant in certain areas, making it very difficult for blacks to register to vote. In 1965, an Alabama city became the battleground in the fight for suffrage. Despite violent opposition, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) and his followers pressed forward on an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, and their efforts culminated in President Lyndon Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<p>
					<p class="achievements">DuVernay became the first Black woman to be nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, as well as the first Black female director to have her film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.</p>
